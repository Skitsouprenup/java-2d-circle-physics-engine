# java-2d-circle-physics-engine
A simple 2D physics engine for circle objects. This is my attempt to
write a physics engine in java in 2020. **This physics engine is not fully
polished. I created this project for fun and experimentation only.** 

I'm planning to rewrite this physics engine in C or Rust in the future.
Before that, I need a refresher on maths and physics.

I have a quick demo of this project in this [link](https://youtu.be/92ttC2Bv0sg)

# Technologies Used
* **Java**
* **Java Swing UI**

# Testing this project
Note: You must have a JDK and JRE installed in your system in order to test this
project.

Compile the project first. Go to the root folder of the project and open terminal
if you're using linux or cmd if you're using windows. Then, type this command:  
`javac main/PhysicsEngine.java`

Next, let's run the project. Go to the root folder of the project again, open
terminal or cmd and then type this command:  
`java main/PhysicsEngine`

The project should be running by now. If not, try using lower version of java
like JDK11 or JDK17. If I remember correctly, I created this project using
JDK11.
